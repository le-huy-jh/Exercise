## Research sarcrifices for performance over readability
It is difficult to come up with an objective answer for if code readability is more important than performance. The degree of readability and performance depend on the nature and requirements of the application. Furthermore, this can vary throughout different parts of the application. Thus, the only one who can make a proper, well-informed decision is the team that is working on the application.

## Good code and bad code
Good code:
-Easy to understand.
-Good code is well-organized.Data and operations in classes fit together.There aren't extraneous dependenciesbetween classes.
-Considers the by products that are not explicit - like security, compile time, smaller operations, number of calls, etc.
-Runs in reasonable time.
-Comments explain why things are done not what is done.The code itself explains what is done.The need for comments should be minimal.
-Uses meaningful naming conventions for all but the most transient of objects.
Bad code:
-Bad code looks like something which was put in a hurry without giving any semblance of thought.
-No documentation.
-Unnecessarily use of loops and jumps statements.
-Take lot of times and resource to execute than usual.
Poor coding standard and style.
Complex and not straight forward.

## Students are able to create a list what needed to be done for this tasks using top-down approach and give out estimatiuon of the time to work on the task
-Look to the past
-Contingencies are a must
-Use detailed descriptions
-Check everything
